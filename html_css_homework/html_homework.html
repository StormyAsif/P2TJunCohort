                A spirometer is a device used to measure lung function, particularly in diagnosing conditions like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
                This is a step-by-step guide on how to use a spirometer properly.

            <!--Ordered list below-->
                <ol>
                    <li>Wash Your Hands
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ensure your hands are clean before handling the spirometer to prevent any potential contamination.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Set Up the Spirometer
                        <ul>
                            <li>Place the spirometer on a flat, stable surface within easy reach. Make sure it's correctly connected <br> to any necessary power sources or calibration devices, as per the manufacturer's instructions.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Position Yourself
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sit or stand in an upright position with good posture. <br> Keep your back straight, and make sure your feet are flat on the floor.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Adjust the Mouthpiece or Face Mask
                        <ul>
                            <li>Some spirometers use a disposable mouthpiece, while others might have a face mask option,<br> especially for younger children or individuals who cannot use a mouthpiece. <br> Ensure that the mouthpiece or face mask is properly connected to the spirometer. <br> If it's disposable, attach a new one before each use.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Perform a Pre-Test Check
                        <ul>
                            <li>If your spirometer has a calibration feature, perform a pre-test calibration <br> as instructed by the manufacturer. This step ensures the accuracy of the measurements.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Take a Deep Breath
                        <ul>
                            <li>Take a few normal breaths to relax. Before starting the test, <br> ensure your lungs are as full of air as possible.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Start the Test
                        <ul>When ready, close your lips around the mouthpiece <br> or put on the face mask securely. Maintain a tight seal <br> to prevent any air from escaping during the test.</ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Inhale and Exhale into the Spirometer
                        <ul>
                            <li>Follow the instructions provided by the spirometer or healthcare professional. <br>Generally, you'll be asked to inhale fully and then exhale as forcefully and completely <br> as you can into the device. The test will usually last for a few seconds.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Repeat the Test
                        <ul>
                            <li>In most cases, you'll need to repeat the test two or three times <br> to ensure consistency and accuracy. Rest for a brief moment between each test to recover.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Record the Results
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your healthcare provider or the spirometer will record and interpret the results. <br> Spirometry results are often expressed in terms of various lung volumes and flow rates,<br> such as Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1).                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>Remember, the accuracy of the results depends on your effort during the test, so give your best effort to get the most accurate measurement of your lung function. <br> If you have any concerns or questions about the test or your results, be sure to discuss them with your healthcare provider.</p>
